# Express.js Note Taker

## Description
This note taker would ideally allow a user to add and delete notes from the notes.html page. To achieve this, setting up proper routing between the server and client-side of this application was necessary. Unfortunately, not all functionality was acheived in this project prior to the deadline.

## Installation
No installation necessary.

## Usage
The user is able to click through and access the notes page. They are able to contribute notes to the database. 

## Credits 
HTML starter code for the index.html and notes.html files, CSS starter code for the styles.css file, and Javascript starter code for the index.js file and clog.js middleware files provided by UT Austin Fullstack Bootcamp.
